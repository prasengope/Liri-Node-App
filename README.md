# Liri-Node-App
This app is going to search for a song, movie and a band's schedules using Node.js. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

# How the app works
The app Liri works by on the command line off of Node.js. These are the phrases that are used to invoke LIRI:
  -node liri.js <movie-this> <movie name> for searching for any movie info using omdb api, 
  -node liri.js <spotify-this> <song name> to get info on song using Node Spotify API npm package and finally
  -node liri.js <concert-this> <band/artist name>  to get the dates and venues of music concerts of your chosen artist or band.
